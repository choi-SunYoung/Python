  Using the boilerplate, make a program that **gets urls as an input** and checks if they are **online or not**.

  - The program should accept any number of URLs separated by comma, with or without 'http', with or without **spaces, uppercase or lowercase**. You need to handle all the cases.
  - You need to check if the URL is legit or not.
  - The user can restart the program after it's finished.
